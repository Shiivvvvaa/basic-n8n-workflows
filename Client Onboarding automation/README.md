# Client Onboarding Automation

**Description**  
This workflow is to automate the basic level client onboarding process for any service-provider business. 

**Functioning**  
Each time the client fills out the onboarding form, this workflow gets triggered. It then stores their information into a google sheets database, sends them a welcome email(including a calendar link for a kick-off meeting). It also creates an authentic Notion page specifically for the client's business.
And finally it sends an email to our business including their information, all the confirmations, and the link to the created Notion page.  

**Impact:**  
The client onboarding process for a small to mid-sized business becomes easy and conveninent. 
Ensures client satisfaction on the other hand as well, and can save the team HOURS they spend on the onboarding process doing it manually. 

**Tools Used:**  
n8n, GMAIL, Open Ai API, Notion
